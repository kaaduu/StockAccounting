# AI Agent Instructions

This project is actively maintained with the help of AI agents. To ensure consistency and high-quality documentation, follow these rules during every session:

1.  **Update CHANGES.md**: Every time you complete a significant task or implement a new feature, update `CHANGES.md` with a concise summary of the changes. This is the source of truth for the project's evolution.
2.  **Language Requirements**: All changes to `README.md` and `CHANGES.md` must be written only in Czech language. Do not add or modify English content in these files.
3.  **Modernization Standards**: Adhere to Java 21+ coding standards. Avoid deprecated APIs and prefer modern alternatives (e.g., `java.time` for date/time logic, generics for collections).
4.  **Documentation First**: Ensure all new files or major architectural changes are documented in the relevant `.md` files. Maintain the `walkthrough.md` if significant new workflows are added.
5.  **Verify Build Integrity**: Always run `./build.sh` before concluding a task to ensure the project remains in a compilable state.
6.  **Git Best Practices**: Follow the project's git commit workflow (using temporary files for commit messages) and always verify the current branch before committing.
